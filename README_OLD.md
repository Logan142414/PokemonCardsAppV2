## Overview

The Pokémon Price Tracker is a Python web scraping project designed to track Pokémon card prices and analyze market trends over time. The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Real time price scraping and filtering (Part 1)**
2. **Historical tracking, cloud storage, and interactive analysis (Part 2)**

## Features

### Part 1: Web Scraping & Streamlit App

* Scrapes Pokémon card names and prices from [PriceCharting.com](https://www.pricecharting.com/).
* Extracts ungraded, Grade 9, and PSA 10 prices.
* Interactive Streamlit app with:
  * One-click dataset refresh
  * Filtering by price, set, or grading
  * “Deal value” calculation (Grade 9 price minus ungraded price)
  * Card image previews
* Learned techniques:

  * HTML inspection and parsing with BeautifulSoup
  * Requests for automated data retrieval
  * Handling partially loaded data

### Part 2: Historical Tracking & Analysis

* Uses Google Cloud Storage to store historical data (Adds to the saved dataset every time the refresh button is pressed on a new day).
* Tracks daily snapshots of card prices.
* Calculates price changes over 3, 7, 14, and 30-day periods.
* Visualizations:
  * Average price changes over time (bar chart)
  * Ungraded price trends (line chart)
* CSV export for offline and further analysis.
* Prioritizes scraping high value cards using URL sorting by price.

## Technical Details

**Languages & Libraries:**

* Python, Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, Requests

**Scraping Approach:**

1. Inspect HTML structure of card sets and individual cards.
2. Extract relevant `<table>` and `<td>` elements.
3. Use Python loops to iterate over sets and append data to a dataset.
4. For historical tracking, append daily snapshots to a cumulative CSV in cloud storage.

## Project Learnings

* Inspecting HTML and understanding web structure is crucial for effective scraping.
* APIs are often a more reliable alternative to scraping.
* Automating historical tracking and cloud storage ensures data persistence and trend analysis.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Full dataset capture using browser automation tools.
* Automate daily scraping.
* Explore AI methods for insights into price trends and investment suggestions.
